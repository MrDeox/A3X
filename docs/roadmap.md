# AÂ³X Development Roadmap

## Checklist for Implementation

### 1. Integration and Testing of `SharedTaskContext`
- [ ] **Update Fragment Classes**: Modify `BaseFragment` and its subclasses to explicitly accept and utilize `SharedTaskContext` for inter-Fragment communication, ensuring alignment with the hierarchical structure.
- [ ] **Test `read_file` Skill**: Verify that the `read_file` skill correctly updates the `SharedTaskContext` with the last read file path.
- [ ] **Test `execute_code` Skill**: Confirm that the `execute_code` skill can resolve placeholders like `$LAST_READ_FILE` from the `SharedTaskContext` and execute the code successfully.
- [ ] **Document Findings**: Record any issues or successes during testing to refine the integration of `SharedTaskContext`.

### 2. Enhancement of the Orquestrador
- [ ] **Context Utilization**: Enhance the Orquestrador to leverage `SharedTaskContext` for decision-making and task delegation, ensuring it can access and update context data.
- [ ] **Task Delegation Logic**: Implement logic to automatically delegate tasks to appropriate Fragments or Managers based on context data.
- [ ] **Feedback Loop**: Develop a mechanism for the Orquestrador to receive feedback from lower levels of the hierarchy through `SharedTaskContext`, enabling adaptive planning.

### 3. Implementation of Evolutionary Ideas
- [ ] **Hypothesis Board**: Design and implement a system for generating and testing hypotheses to improve system performance and adaptability.
- [ ] **Attention Mechanism**: Develop an attention mechanism to prioritize tasks and data within the `SharedTaskContext`, focusing on critical information.
- [ ] **Other Evolutionary Concepts**: Identify and implement additional evolutionary ideas that align with the manifestos, such as automatic Fragment generation based on capacity gaps.

### 4. Codebase Management
- [ ] **Merge Pending Branches**: Integrate the changes from `feat/adapt-read-file-context` and the adaptation of `execute_code` into the `main` branch after successful testing.
- [ ] **Version Control**: Ensure all changes are documented and versioned appropriately for traceability.
- [ ] **Code Review**: Conduct a thorough review of the merged code to ensure quality and adherence to the manifestos.

### 5. Documentation and Manifesto Updates
- [ ] **Update Manifestos**: Revise the existing manifestos to reflect any new insights or changes in implementation strategy.
- [ ] **Implementation Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for each implemented feature, explaining how it aligns with the philosophical principles.
- [ ] **Roadmap Review**: Periodically review and update this checklist to adapt to new challenges or opportunities.
