# A³X Project Overview

## 1. High-Level Summary

A³X (Sistema de Inteligência Artificial Simbiótica) is an ambitious and complex Python-based framework designed to create an autonomous, evolving, and self-improving AI system. Its primary goal is to build an artificial intelligence that can not only perform complex tasks but also learn from its experiences, adapt its own structure, and collaborate with humans in a symbiotic manner.

The core philosophy revolves around integrating symbolic processing (referred to as A3L) and neural processing (A3Net) to achieve a more robust and flexible form of intelligence. The system emphasizes modularity, continuous learning, and the ability to evolve its capabilities over time, much like a biological organism. It aims to use Large Language Models (LLMs) as mentors or guides within its cognitive architecture, rather than as sole executors of tasks.

## 2. Key Architectural Concepts

A³X's architecture is built upon several key concepts that enable its modularity and evolutionary nature:

*   **Fragments:** These are the fundamental building blocks of A³X. Fragments are specialized, independent, and often autonomous units of competence, each responsible for a specific aspect of a task or a particular cognitive function. They are designed to be lightweight and focused.
*   **Skills:** Skills are atomic functions that perform concrete operations, such_as file manipulation, web searching, code execution, or image analysis. Fragments use Skills to interact with the environment or perform specific actions.
*   **TaskOrchestrator:** This is the central nervous system of A³X. The `TaskOrchestrator` receives high-level objectives, breaks them down into manageable sub-tasks, and delegates these tasks to appropriate Fragments. It monitors the overall progress and coordinates the flow of execution.
*   **FragmentRegistry & ToolRegistry:**
    *   `FragmentRegistry`: Manages the discovery and registration of all available Fragments within the system. This allows the Orchestrator to dynamically find and utilize Fragments based on their declared capabilities.
    *   `ToolRegistry` (SkillRegistry): Manages the discovery and registration of Skills. This allows Fragments to access the tools they need.
*   **Hierarchical Structure (Pyramid Model):** The system often operates on a hierarchical model:
    *   **Strategist (Top):** Typically the `TaskOrchestrator`, responsible for high-level planning and goal definition.
    *   **Managers/Coordinators (Middle):** Fragments that may manage sub-tasks or coordinate other Fragments within a specific domain (e.g., a `FileManagerFragment` coordinating various file operation skills).
    *   **Executors (Base):** Fragments or Skills that perform the specific, low-level actions.
*   **SharedTaskContext:** A communication backbone that allows different components (Orchestrator, Fragments) to share information, state, and context related to a specific task. This is crucial for collaboration and maintaining coherence during complex operations.
*   **MemoryManager:** Responsible for persistent storage and retrieval of information, including episodic memory (past events), semantic memory (learned knowledge), and heuristics. This component is vital for the system's learning capabilities.
*   **Symbolic (A3L) and Neural (A3Net) Integration:** While details are embedded deep within the codebase, the project names `a3x/a3lang` and `a3x/a3net` suggest an intention to combine rule-based symbolic reasoning with data-driven neural network processing. This hybrid approach aims to leverage the strengths of both paradigms.

## 3. Core Principles of Operation

The functionality and evolution of A³X are guided by several core principles, many of which are detailed in the project's manifestos (`docs/manifesto.md`):

*   **Fragmentação Cognitiva (Cognitive Fragmentation):** Large objectives are automatically decomposed into smaller, manageable tasks. These tasks are then delegated to specialized, lightweight Fragments, each operating with minimal necessary context and a focused set of skills.
*   **Evolução Modular baseada em Prompts (Modular Prompt-based Evolution):** Fragments primarily evolve by adjusting their instructional prompts or the tools (Skills) available to them, rather than through direct fine-tuning of underlying base models. This allows for rapid, lightweight, and efficient adaptation.
*   **Criação Dinâmica de Fragments (Dynamic Fragment Creation):** The system is designed to identify gaps in its knowledge or capabilities (e.g., through repeated failures) and autonomously create new Fragments to address these deficiencies, enabling continuous architectural evolution.
*   **Memória Evolutiva (Evolutionary Memory):** A³X aims to convert specific task experiences and interactions into consolidated, reusable heuristics. This allows the system to accumulate practical wisdom, avoid repeating past mistakes, and optimize future decisions.
*   **Auto-Otimização dos Fragments (Fragment Self-Optimization):** Individual Fragments can monitor their own performance and autonomously adjust their behavior, prompts, or strategies to improve efficiency and effectiveness over time.
*   **Conversa Interna entre Fragments (Internal Conversation between Fragments):** Fragments can communicate directly with each other, typically in natural language, to resolve ambiguities, share perspectives, or collaborate on complex tasks, reducing the cognitive load on the central Orchestrator.
*   **Agrupamento Funcional de Skills (Functional Skill Grouping):** Skills are organized into logical domains (e.g., file operations, data analysis), with specific Manager Fragments potentially overseeing each domain to promote cohesion and efficiency.
*   **Gestão Dinâmica da Hierarquia (Dynamic Hierarchy Management):** Manager Fragments can assess the performance of other Fragments, potentially promoting effective ones to roles of greater responsibility or demoting/reallocating less effective ones.
*   **Especialização Progressiva dos Fragments (Progressive Fragment Specialization):** As the number of Fragments grows, they tend to become more specialized, leading to a deeper and more focused cognitive base.
*   **Automação de Interface (Hacking Criativo) (Interface Automation - Creative Hacking):** The system can interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using computer vision and automation techniques, allowing it to operate systems or access data even without official APIs.
*   **Containerização Segura e Modo Sandbox Autônomo (Secure Containerization and Autonomous Sandbox Mode):** Dynamically generated code is executed in isolated environments (e.g., using Firejail) for safety. A sandbox mode allows the system to explore creative solutions independently.
*   **Escuta Contínua e Aprendizado Contextual (Continuous Listening and Contextual Learning - Experimental):** An experimental concept to capture ambient audio (with user consent) to enrich contextual understanding and learning.

## 4. System's Execution Flow

Understanding how A³X processes tasks and learns involves several stages:

1.  **Task Initiation:**
    *   A task typically begins when a high-level objective is provided to the system. This can happen through:
        *   The `A3XUnified.execute_task()` method (as seen in `a3x/core/a3x_unified.py`).
        *   The Command Line Interface (CLI) (`a3x/cli/main.py`).
        *   An API endpoint (`a3x/api/main.py`).
        *   An internally generated goal from an autonomous cycle.

2.  **Orchestration by `TaskOrchestrator`:**
    *   The `TaskOrchestrator` receives the objective.
    *   It analyzes the objective and, using its knowledge of available Fragments and the current context, breaks it down into a sequence of smaller, executable steps or sub-tasks.
    *   For each step, it selects the most appropriate Fragment(s) from the `FragmentRegistry`.

3.  **Fragment Execution:**
    *   The selected Fragment receives the sub-task and relevant context (via `SharedTaskContext`).
    *   The Fragment then executes its specialized logic. This often involves:
        *   Utilizing one or more Skills (tools) from the `ToolRegistry` to perform specific actions (e.g., read a file, call an LLM, search the web).
        *   Communicating with other Fragments if necessary ("Conversa Interna").
        *   Making decisions based on its internal logic and learned heuristics.
    *   Results from Skill execution and Fragment processing are typically stored back in the `SharedTaskContext` or memory.

4.  **Monitoring and Iteration:**
    *   The `TaskOrchestrator` monitors the execution of Fragments.
    *   Based on the outcome of a step (success, failure, new information), the Orchestrator decides the next course of action. This might involve:
        *   Proceeding to the next step in the plan.
        *   Re-planning if a step failed or new critical information has emerged.
        *   Delegating to a `DebuggerFragment` or `ReflectorFragment` to analyze failures.
    *   This loop continues until the overall objective is achieved, deemed unachievable, or a maximum step limit is reached.

5.  **Learning and Autonomous Cycles:**
    *   **Post-Task Reflection:** After a task (or even during), the system can trigger reflection processes. Components like `ReflectorFragment` or `MetaReflectorFragment` analyze the execution logs, successes, and failures stored in memory.
    *   **Heuristic Generation (`Memória Evolutiva`):** Insights from reflection are consolidated into heuristics, improving the system's decision-making for future tasks.
    *   **Skill/Fragment Evolution:** Based on performance, prompts for LLM-based Fragments might be refined (`Evolução Modular`). The system might identify needs for new skills or even entirely new Fragments (`Criação Dinâmica de Fragments`, `propose_skill_from_gap` skill).
    *   **Autonomous Cycles (`AutonomousSelfStarterFragment`):** A³X can initiate its own cycles of activity, driven by internal goals like "learn more about X" or "improve skill Y." These cycles follow a similar flow but are self-directed, contributing to the system's ongoing evolution and knowledge acquisition.

This entire process is designed to be iterative. The system doesn't just execute tasks; it actively learns from them to improve its future performance and adapt its own structure.

## 5. Key Capabilities

Based on its architecture, core principles, and the variety of available Skills and Fragments, A³X possesses (or aims to develop) the following key capabilities:

*   **Code Analysis, Generation, and Execution:**

## 6. How to Use the System

While the A³X system is complex, there are a few primary ways to interact with it:

*   **Using `A3XUnified` (Programmatic Access):**
    *   The `a3x.core.a3x_unified.A3XUnified` class provides a high-level interface to the system.
    *   As shown in its `if __name__ == "__main__":` block and the project's main `README.md`:
        1.  Instantiate `A3XUnified`.
        2.  Call the `await system.setup()` method to initialize all components (LLM interface, registries, memory, etc.).
        3.  Execute tasks using `await system.execute_task("Your objective here")`.
        4.  Initiate autonomous learning cycles with `await system.start_autonomous_cycle()`.
        5.  Ensure `await system.cleanup()` is called to shut down resources gracefully.
    *   This is likely the intended method for integrating A³X into other Python applications or for complex scripting.

*   **Command Line Interface (CLI):**
    *   The `a3x/cli/main.py` module suggests a CLI for interacting with A³X.
    *   The exact commands and functionalities would need to be explored by running `python -m a3x.cli.main --help` (or similar, depending on how `pyproject.toml` sets up entry points).
    *   CLIs are typically used for direct user interaction, scripting, and administrative tasks.

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   The `a3x/api/main.py` module indicates the presence of a web API (likely FastAPI or Flask, common in Python projects).
    *   This would allow A³X to be controlled or queried by other applications over a network.
    *   The specific endpoints and their functionalities would be detailed in the API's documentation (if available) or by inspecting the `a3x/api/routes/` directory.

*   **A3L Scripts:**
    *   The `data/a3l_scripts/` directory contains files with the `.a3l` extension. This suggests a custom scripting language (A3L - A³X Language) might be used to define tasks, behaviors, or learning processes for the symbolic part of the system.
    *   The `a3x/a3lang/interpreter.py` further supports this.

**Starting Points for Exploration:**

*   Begin with the `A3XUnified` class as it's well-documented in the README.
*   Explore the scripts in `scripts/dev/` and `scripts/dev/a3net_examples/` for more practical examples of how different parts of the system are used.
*   Consult the main `README.md` for installation and basic setup instructions.

## 7. Project Structure Overview
